# Dallas-Police-Data
Visual analysis of Offense Types

We have hunches about when robberies or car accidents happen but does the data back them up? 
Visualization of different offense types reported to the [Dallas police (2014-present)](https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Dallas-Police-Public-Data-RMS-Incidents/tbnj-w5hb), accessible via [Socrata API](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/www.dallasopendata.com/qqc2-eivj), provides some answers. See the Jupyter notebook for details of the analysis performed in Python with matplotlib, plotly and modeling with scikit.
